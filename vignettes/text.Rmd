Basilica provides 2 functions for working with images:

- `embed_sentence`
- `embed_sentences`

The `embed_sentence` function takes a single `characther` vector (a string) and
returns a vector of features. The `embed_sentences` functions takes a list of
`character` vectors returns a matrix with a feature vector on every row.

#### `embed_sentece`

```r
sentences <- c(
  "This is a sentence!",
  "This is a similar sentence!",
  "I don't think this sentence is very similar at all..."
)

library('basilica')
connect("SLOW_DEMO_KEY")

embeddings <- list()
embeddings[[1]] <- embed_sentence(sentence[[1]])
embeddings[[2]] <- embed_sentence(sentence[[2]])
embeddings[[3]] <- embed_sentence(sentence[[3]])

print(cor(embeddings[[1]], embeddings[[2]]))
print(cor(embeddings[[1]], embeddings[[3]]))
```

#### `embed_senteces`

```r
sentences <- c(
  "This is a sentence!",
  "This is a similar sentence!",
  "I don't think this sentence is very similar at all..."
)

library('basilica')
connect("SLOW_DEMO_KEY")

embeddings <- embed_sentences(sentences)

print(cor(embeddings[1,], embeddings[2,]))
print(cor(embeddings[1,], embeddings[3,]))
```
